title: DS Project No 1 - Predict Response to Consumer's Complaints
tags: [Data Cleaning, Logistic Regression, GBM]
---

The purpose of this project is to build a classification model to predict whether a consumer's complain would get timely response or not. If the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could have the insight that which complaint may not be receiving responses in time from a company, they may conduct extra measures to accelerate the process. <br>
We will use the Financial Product Consumer Complaint Data in this project. The dataset can be downloaded from https://data.consumerfinance.gov/api/views/s6ew-h6mp/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD. A description of each variable in the dataset can be found from: https://cfpb.github.io/api/ccdb/fields.html. <br>
